A decision tree is a supervised algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
It splits data into subsets based on the most significant feature.
Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature.
Each leaf node represents the predicted outcome.
Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize.
However, they can be prone to overfitting.
Common applications include recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.
